<h2>Contributing Patches</h2>
<p>Well-described, easy-to-apply patches are a pleasure for a developer
to receive and go a long way towards making the
Java Advanced Imaging Image I/O Tools projects
more stable and powerful, so thank you in advance for contributing
them! </p>
<h3>Making and applying a patch</h3>
<p>First, make sure you are making changes in the most recent version
of the sources. For this, it is best to use CVS to check out the source
(usually on the CVS trunk; sometimes the most active release branch -
ask if unsure), make your modifications (but do not check them in), and
then run (example for Unix, other operating systems similar):</p>
<p><code>$ cd /cvs-parent-dir</code></p>
<p><code>$ ls</code></p>
<p>shows all of the Java Advanced Imaging Image I/O Tools projects</p>
<p><code>$ cvs update <em>ProjectName</em></code></p>
<p>make sure you are working against current sources (note that <em>ProjectName</em>
is the name of the project, for example
jai-imageio-core)<br>
</p>
<p><code>$ cvs diff <em>ProjectName</em></code></p>
<p>sanity-check the change</p>
<p><code>$ cvs -f diff -u -N <em>ProjectName</em> &gt;
/tmp/my-patch.diff</code></p>
<p>sanity-check the patch</p>
<p>If you are adding or modifying binary files, it is best to attach
the
new or modified binary files separately and exclude them from the
textual patch.</p>
<p>Common patch mistakes include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Forgetting <code>-u</code>. Default-format diffs show no
context and will be <em>hard to read and apply</em>, especially if
they were made against somewhat out-of-date sources. <code>-c</code>
is also OK but <code>-u</code> is most common.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Forgetting about new (added) files. Run <code>cvs add</code>
(but do not commit!) to make sure CVS thinks of them as added as part
of the patch, and remember <code>-N</code> which includes them in the
patch. Also run <code>cvs remove</code> (but do not commit) when a
patch should delete some files.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using other switches such as <code>-t</code> which can make the
patch difficult to apply.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Starting from the wrong directory. <em>Always</em> make patches
from the root of the source tree to avoid confusion.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Manually editing patches. You may be tempted to concatenate
patches, or manually edit them to exclude things you do not really want
to submit. <em>Do not do this.</em> The patch may be corrupted as a
result. Fix your sources to reflect what you want the result to be, and
run a fresh diff. Include all affected files in the diff command, even
if they are in different modules.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Including extraneous changes. Look over your patch to make sure
every change relates to the fix you are making, and is necessary.
Remember other people will read your patch before applying it! Do not
make gratuitous whitespace changes. Do not reformat existing code you
are not modifying.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using the plain diff command. Use <code>cvs diff</code> to
ensure that exact information about repository path and original
version of the patched files is retained.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using old sources. Patches made against obsolete sources may be
hard to use. Make sure you are using recent versions of all source file
(<code>cvs&nbsp;update</code> first). If you must submit several
patches against the same files, be sure to indicate if they must be
applied in some particular order.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>A properly made patch is easy to apply by someone with commit
access who has reviewed it. Use of the Unix <code>patch</code> tool
is recommended; Windows users should be able to get it from the
Cygwin tools distribution.</p>
<p>save patch to disk, say /tmp/suggested-patch.diff</p>
<p><code>$ cd /cvs-parent-dir</code></p>
<p><code>$ patch -p0 --dry-run &lt; /tmp/suggested-patch.diff</code></p>
<p>make sure no errors are reported - this just tests the patch format</p>
<p><code>$ patch -p0 &lt; /tmp/suggested-patch.diff</code></p>
<p><code>$ cvs diff <em>ProjectName</em></code> (or whatever part of
sources are affected)</p>
<p>sanity-check diff, compare to patch (should be same or similar)</p>
<p>test, do a build, commit as usual</p>
<p>If the "dry run" fails, you may need to use additional
options to <code>patch</code>, or at worst just apply the patch
manually. Do not forget to sanity-check file additions and removals!
You probably need to use <code>cvs add</code> and <code>cvs remove</code>
to complete these.</p>
<h3>Making a patch available and accepting it</h3>
<p>The best way to submit a patch is through Issue Tracking. In some
cases you could send it as a MIME attachment to the proper mailing
list if it is a short patch and you are more expecting it to
looked at for comments than applied as is. But usually patches ought
to be put in Issue Tracking.</p>
<p>First, if an issue describing the problem (or feature) you are
trying to solve already exists, use it. If it does not, create an
issue, and mark it to be of type <code>PATCH</code>. The issue should
include at least the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The patch file itself, of course - as an Issue Tracking
attachment, <em>not</em> pasted into the <b>Description</b> field.
(Line-wrapped or reformatted patches are not usable. They must be
exactly as produced by <code>cvs diff</code>.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A description of what problem you are trying to fix, if possible
with steps to reproduce it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A description of what the behavior should be with the patch in
place. Ideally also steps to demonstrate that the patch fixes the
described problem.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If reasonable, a description of how the patch works.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a significant amount of code is involved, it is safest to
mention in the issue comments that you agree to let the patch be used
under the project's license as part of the project's code. If you are
adding new source files, they must be marked with the project's license
notice or the patch cannot be accepted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If this is your first code submission to any of the Java
Advanced Imaging
Image I/O Tools projects, you must submit a <a
 href="contribute.html#JCA">Joint
Copyright Assignment</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The patch submitter should be either the submitter of the issue,
or add him or herself to the CC list of the issue (format: <code><i>loginname</i></code>).
This ensures that the submitter will see any comments or changes made
to the issue and be able to respond if needed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The developer responsible for the section of code affected should
either apply the patch and mark the issue <code>FIXED</code>; or add a
comment with an objection if the patch does not seem safe, does not
appear to fix the problem, or there is not really a problem to begin
with. Developers must also confirm that the contributor has signed and
submitted a JCA before commiting their patch, by checking the list
of&nbsp; approved contributors that will be created as the Joint
Copyright Assignment forms are received.<br>
</p>
<p>Notifications of any changes to Issue Tracking, as well as CVS
checkins, are automatically sent to the appropriate bug and CVS
mailing lists, so you can monitor if the patch has really been
applied. Make sure you subscribe to at least the CVS and bug mailing
lists for the module you are working on - see the project's mailing
lists page for details.</p>
<p>Of course, if you do not know exactly how to fix a problem, but
have an idea that it is being caused by a certain section of code
somehow, you can just mention what you know on the developer list and
maybe someone else will know how to fix it. And please <a
 href="https://jai-imageio.dev.java.net/#Reporting_Issues">report
a bug</a> about it so it does not get lost.</p>
