<h3>How You Can Contribute</h3>
<p>Here are some of the ways you can contribute to the Java Advanced
Imaging Image I/O Tools
projects: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><b>Participate on Forums and Mailing Lists</b><br>
The <a target="_blank"
 href="https://jai-imageio.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectForumView">Java
Advanced Imaging
Image I/O Tools project forum</a> and
mailing lists provide a way for people
using the software to benefit from each other's expertise. To really
be useful, these lists need <i>your</i> input! Please don't be afraid
to
post: help out others when you can, post your questions,
comments and ideas as you see fit. See the <a
 href="https://jai-imageio.dev.java.net/#Feedback_and_Discussion">Feedback
&amp; Discussion</a>
section for more information. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>File a Bug Report</b><br>
Bug reports are very helpful to developers, and a great way to
contribute to a project! Please use the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Issue Tracker</span> in the appropriate
jai sub-project to file bugs (defects). Remember to take a little time
when <a href="https://jai-imageio.dev.java.net/#Reporting_Issues">filing
a bug
report</a>;
make sure you can
reproduce the problem, and be very explicit in your description of the
problem. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>File an Enhancement Request</b><br>
If there's something you'd like to see in a project and don't, or
something you can imagine improving, let us know by filing an
enhancement request. Use the appropriate sub-project's <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Issue Tracker</span> and file
an "Enhancement" rather than a "Defect". </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Contributing Code</b><br>
As mentioned above, all of the source code is available, and if
there's a feature you'd like to see, or a bug you'd like to see fixed,
you have the power to make that happen. See the sections on <a
 href="patches.html">contributing patches</a>
for more information. Don't forget to <a href="#JCA">submit
a Joint
Copyright Assignment</a> form if this is your first contribution.<br>
